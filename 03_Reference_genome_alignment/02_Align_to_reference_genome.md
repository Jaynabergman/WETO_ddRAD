# Align reads to reference genome

## Background

### Inputs

### Flags

## Running alignment


### Outputs

## Notes
Normally at this step we would want to sort and index the aligned reads. However, in this case for the western toad genome we cannot index the alignments because the scaffolds are too large to be build in the BAM format.
